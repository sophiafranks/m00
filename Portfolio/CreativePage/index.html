      <h2>About This Page...</h2>
     
        Here you will find some of the various things I have created spanning through 9th-12th grade. Some of these have been for school, while others have been for myself. 
      
      <h2>My Photography...</h2>

      <figure>
        <img src="https://sophiafranks.github.io/moo/Portfolio/images/wolf.webp" alt="A photo I took of a white wolf, walking away from the camera in a forest" style="width:100%">
        <figcaption>This is a photo I took in 9th grade during a field trip at the Woodland Park Zoo for my Photography class. I remember struggling with switching between my standard and telephoto lens because I was new to it. It was raining that day, which made
          every photo and every switch of my lenses a little nerve wrecking. I remember opening up the files on the SD card and being stoked that I managed to capture this one. It felt so candid compared to the others. When I looked at it, I could let
          myself forget that this was taken at a zoo, and not in an actual forest. </figcaption>

      <h2>My Traditional Art...</h2>

      <figure>
        <img src="https://sophiafranks.github.io/moo/Portfolio/images/vanitaswatercolor.jpg" alt="A watercolor/colored pencil piece of a character" style="width:100%">
        <figcaption>This peice is particularly special to me. I do not remember what grade I was in when I started and finished it, but I remember that it had to be during Covid. Like most of my art, it was a rollercoaster of emotions. When I started the sketch I
          felt as if I could never acheive the feeling I wanted. When the sketch was completed, and I began to color it, I felt really proud, it was coming out well! Then about halfway through, I was in the strange limbo space of the coloring stage where
          I feel like I did something I cannot take back. Something was colored too deeply and there was no way to fix it. Fortunately, I was aware that this was me just panicking, and I had to trust my own process. Luckily, it all worked out. This was
          the first watercolor piece I had done in years, and for it to turn out so well made me fall back in love with the medium. It makes me happy.</figcaption>

      <h2>A Video...</h2>

      <br>

          <source src="https://sophiafranks.github.io/moo/Portfolio/images/finalanimationmp4file.mp4" type="video/mp4">

        </video>
        <figcaption>This was the finished product of my Freedom Project 10th grade. Looking back at it, I see where I could have made many improvements to the structure, flow and consistency of the animation. When I look back on this, I am reminded of how much time
          I have had to pursue my creative passions, but have gotten overwhelmed and said "I'll just do it another day." This was the last animation project I have done since. Looking back on this, I want to animate again, but I feel like the time to
          do so is rapidly flowing from my hands. Time, much like water, cannot be kept cradled in the palms of ones hands.</figcaption>

          <figcaption> Here is a link to a video essay that I really enjoyed. I didn't know what else to link to so I decided to share this.  </figcaption>
