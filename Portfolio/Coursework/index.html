      <h2><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=12&coid=49364" target="_blank">Intro to Web Development - Current</a></h2>
      <p>
        PROG109 - Adam Brehm </br> In this course, I have learned how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop my own website. There have been a lot of ups and downs during this course. The most notable one was when I got sick for a solid 3 weeks.
        Keeping up with some of the material was hard, but finally solving some of the issues I came across felt incredibly rewarding. I think the largest takeaway from this course will be that I now feel like I have a solid foundation of HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript skills.

      </p>
      <h2> <a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=35432" target="_blank">Intro to Hand Power Tools - Spring Quarter </a> </h2>
      <p>
        ART108 - Tahle Patton </br> This was a half-quarter class where I learned how to use various power tools to create a bench of my own design. Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the final class because that was when I fell terribly ill. I am
        sad that I missed out on that.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=37008" target="_blank">American Government - Winter Quarter </a></h2>
      <p>
        POLS202 - Tim Jones </br> In this course, I learned about our own system of government, its history, intricacies, and many different political ideologies. I also kept up with the current news. This class was also a challenge for me due to the
        sheer amount of work required every week. I remember that the midterm overlapped with my visit to San Jose to visit my sister. I immediately caught Covid. I was completely miserable; studying for an already daunting midterm while in an unfamiliar
        space while I was sick out of my mind was not fun. Luckily, I ended up getting the highest score on that midterm out of the entire class (95/100). After that, I felt like I could conquer the entire world! I think this class was the right kind
        of hard. I was forced to learn the material, and I feel like I gained a lot from that. I still find myself using knowledge I gained from this class months later.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=36327" target="_blank">US History III - Winter Quarter</a></h2>
      <p>
        HIST148 - Polly Good </br> In this course, I learned more about US History. I cannot remember much from this course, except that I enjoyed a lot of the documentaries we were assigned to watch. There was one documentary on YouTube that covered
        the Panama Canal. I vividly remember being shocked at how one man, William Gorgas, decided to get rid of Yellow Fever. He ended up waging war on the mosquito population. He would have stagnant water covered in oil so they couldn't reproduce. Anyone
        who had stagnant water and therefore mosquito larvae would be fined 5$, and he would hunt down individual mosquitos. This worked very well as the number of people who came down with Yellow Fever drastically decreased.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=36981" target="_blank">Intro to Physics - Fall Quarter </a></h2>
      <p>
        PHYS100 - Trevor P. Gamble </br> In this course, I learned more about Physics. At the time, I was taking AP Calculus, so the concepts and math were extremely easy to learn. I had some issues with communication with the professor, and the way the
        material was taught was very strange. It was just handwritten lecture notes that were emailed to us sporadically.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=37049" target="_blank">General Psychology - Fall Quarter </a></h2>
      <p>
        PSYC100 - Leo Kiralla </br> In this course, I learned more about Psychology. It was a laid-back course from which I feel I learned some valuable knowledge.

      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=35429" target="_blank">Modern Architecture and Design - Summer Quarter </a></h2>
      <p>
        ART101 - Deborah Leblang </br> In this course, I learned about Modern Architecture and Design. I remember for one of the major assignments, I had to research a famous architect of my choosing. I ended up stumbling into a biography by a friend
        of one of the architects I chose, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue. One of the quotes read as follows:
        <div class="quote-container">
          <p>
            "I remember him best in two aspects: sitting hunched up over a drawing-board, his lips writing nervously around innumerable dropping cigarettes, shifting his pen from one hand to another (he was ambidextrous) as he wrought out some inimitable study in
            dazzling black and white ... He was Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, and in saying that you have said all."
          </p>
        </div>
        I remember late at night, crying over this quote. It, for some reason, struck a nerve in me. That is why I wanted to share it here.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=35475" target="_blank">Survey of Human Disease - Spring Quarter </a></h2>
      <p>
        BIOL125 - Jean Lawler </br> In this course, I learned a lot about both the normal functions of the body, as well as the different ways that diseases manifest and disrupt those normal functions. This class was fast paced, with only written lectures
        being available. It involved a lot of memorization, which I did not entirely enjoy. There were some assignments where we would draw and explain diagrams or research some basic information, but they were not the focus. I learned a lot through this
        class, and I am glad I took it.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=36901" target="_blank">Contemporary Moral Issues - Spring Quarter</a></h2>
      <p>
        PHIL102 - Greg A. Damico </br> In this course, I learned a lot about different Philosophers, contemporary moral issues, and the logic surrounding the different approaches and solutions to those issues. I really liked this class. I remember when
        I took my final, I had the same song on repeat for the entire 3 hours. Now, whenever I listen to that song, I suddenly feel like I am taking the exam again. This class certainly challenged me, but I certainly enjoyed it.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=36325" target="_blank">US History I - Winter Quarter</a></h2>
      <p>
        HIST146 - Sabrina Sanchez </br> In this course, I learned a lot about the early history of our nation. I remember really resonating with the material that was covered. I really enjoyed the blend of lecture and written material. I really connected
        with the primary and secondary sources that were presented in the class, and it led me to do a lot of reflection on the current state of the US.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=35374" target="_blank">American Sign Language II - Winter Quarter</a></h2>
      <p>
        ASL121 - Valentino Vasquez </br> In this course, I continued to practice and learn ASL, as well as gain more information on Deaf Culture. I found this class valuable.
      </p>
      <h2> <a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=36025" target="_blank">Introduction to Literature - Fall Quarter </a></h2>
      <p>
        ENGL111 - Cassie Cross </br> In this course, I read about 3 or 4 books. I was not really interested in the material provided. I am not a poem person, I didn't really enjoy The Great Gatsby or The Chosen and the Beautiful (a reimagining of the
        former). I also was not a fan of Shakespeare. Despite all of this, I found that learning to push through and write analysis on these books with the group I was assigned was valuable.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=35373" target="_blank">American Sign Language I - Fall Quarter </a></h2>
      <p>
        ASL122 - Valentino Vasquez </br> In this course, I learned the basics of ASL and read about the Deaf Community.

      </p>
      <h2> <a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=9&coid=36022" target="_blank">English Composition I - Summer Quarter </a> </h2>
      <p>
        ENGL101 - Steven Dunham </br> This course was my introduction to Bellevue College, and I cannot be more grateful for that. The professor was flexible with me, and I felt like I learned a lot of useful writing skills that have continued to help
        me throughout the 2 years I have been taking classes here.
